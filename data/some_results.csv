101,Israel's military says it has expanded its ground operations to every part of Gaza in pursuit of Hamas.,"Israel ramps up Gaza ground assault Israel ramps up ground assault as more than 100 hostages remain in Gaza 02:52
The Israeli military said Sunday its ground offensive had expanded to every part of Gaza, and it ordered more evacuations in the crowded south while vowing that operations there against Hamas would carry ""no less strength"" than its shattering ones in the north.
Heavy bombardment followed evacuation orders, and Palestinians said they were running out of places to go in the sealed-off territory bordering Israel and Egypt. Many of Gaza's 2.3 million people are crammed into the south after Israel ordered civilians to leave the north in the early days of the war, which was sparked by the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack in Israel that killed about 1,200, mostly civilians.
The United Nations estimates that 1.8 million Palestinians in Gaza have been displaced. Nearly 958,000 of them are in 99 U.N. facilities in the south, said Juliette Toma, director of communications at the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees.
After dark, gunfire and shelling were heard in the central town of Deir al-Balah as flares lit the sky. In Gaza's second-largest city of Khan Younis, Israeli drones buzzed overhead. U.N. human rights chief Volker Türk urged an end to the war, saying civilian suffering was ""too much to bear.""

The Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said the number of people killed there since Oct. 7 has surpassed 15,500, with more than 41,000 wounded. The ministry does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths, but said 70% of the dead were women and children.
A Health Ministry spokesman asserted that hundreds had been killed or wounded since a weeklong cease-fire ended Friday. ""The majority of victims are still under the rubble,"" Ashraf al-Qidra said.
Fears of a wider conflict intensified. A U.S. warship and multiple commercial ships responded to distress signals from container ships in the Red Sea, the Pentagon said. Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels claimed attacks on two ships they described as being linked to Israel but did not acknowledge targeting a U.S. vessel.
Hopes for another temporary truce in Gaza were fading. The cease-fire facilitated the release of dozens of the roughly 240 Gaza-held Israeli and foreign hostages in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. But Israel has called its negotiators home and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the war will continue until ""all its goals"" are achieved. One is to remove Hamas from power in Gaza.
Senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan said resuming talks with Israel on further exchanges must be tied to a permanent cease-fire.
White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told ""Face the Nation"" on CBS News that the U.S. is ""trying to work hour by hour to see if we can get this pause reinstated and get those hostages out.""
""While the pause has been lifted, and no hostage exchanges are going on, what is still going on, importantly, is humanitarian assistance getting in, including fuel, which is critical,"" Kirby added.
Israel's military widened evacuation orders in and around Khan Younis in the south, telling residents of at least five more areas to leave. Residents said the military dropped leaflets calling Khan Younis ""a dangerous combat zone"" and ordering them to move to the border city of Rafah or a coastal area in the southwest.
But Halima Abdel-Rahman, a widow and mother of four, said she won't heed such orders anymore. She fled her home in October to an area outside Khan Younis, where she stays with relatives.
""The occupation tells you to go to this area, then they bomb it,"" she said by phone. ""The reality is that no place is safe in Gaza. They kill people in the north. They kill people in the south.""
The United States, Israel's closest ally, has urged Israel to avoid significant new mass displacement and do more to protect civilians. U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris told Egypt's president that ""under no circumstances"" would the U.S. permit the forced relocation of Palestinians from Gaza or the West Bank, an ongoing siege of Gaza or the redrawing of its borders.
On the ground in Gaza, there was fear and mourning. Outside a Gaza City hospital, a dust-covered boy named Saaed Khalid Shehta dropped to his knees beside the bloodied body of his little brother Mohammad, one of several bodies laid out after people said their street was hit by airstrikes. He kissed him.
""You bury me with him!"" the boy cried. A health worker at Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital said more than 15 children were killed.

Israel's military said its fighter jets and helicopters struck targets in Gaza including ""tunnel shafts, command centers and weapons storage facilities."" It acknowledged ""extensive aerial attacks in the Khan Younis area.""
The bodies of 31 people killed in bombardment of central Gaza were taken to the Al-Aqsa hospital in Deir al-Balah, said Omar al-Darawi, a hospital administrative employee. One woman wept, cradling a child's body. Another carried the body of a baby. Later, hospital workers reported 11 more dead after another airstrike. Bloodied survivors included a child carried in on a mattress.
Outside a hospital morgue in Khan Younis, resident Samy al-Najeila carried the body of a child. He said his sons had been preparing to evacuate their home, ""but the occupation didn't give us any time. The three-floor building was destroyed completely, the whole block was totally destroyed."" He said six of the bodies were his relatives.
""Five people are still under the rubble,"" he said. ""God help us.""
In a video from the same crowded al-Nasser hospital, UNICEF spokesperson James Elder said: ""I feel like I'm almost failing in my ability to convey the endless killing of children here.""
Israel says it does not target civilians and has taken measures to protect them, including its evacuation orders. In addition to leaflets, the military has used phone calls and radio and TV broadcasts to urge people to move from specific areas.
Israel says it targets Hamas operatives and blames civilian casualties on the militants, accusing them of operating in residential neighborhoods. It claims to have killed thousands of militants, without providing evidence. Israel says at least 78 of its soldiers have been killed.
Kirby said that the U.S. is in discussion with Israel ""about being careful, precise and deliberate in their targeting and trying to minimize civilian casualties to the maximum extent possible.""
""I think it's also important for people to remember what they're up against here. Hamas deliberately shelters themselves inside residential buildings, hospitals and schools,"" Kirby said when asked by ""Face the Nation"" host Margaret Brennan if the White House has established ""red lines"" in the terms of U.S. military aid to Israel.
""It's an added burden that Israel has as a modern military, we recognize that, but it's also a very difficult burden and obstacle for them to overcome,"" Kirby said.
The widening offensive likely will further complicate humanitarian aid to Gaza. Wael Abu Omar, a spokesman for the Palestinian Crossings Authority, said 100 aid trucks entered Sunday, but U.N. agencies have said 500 trucks per day on average entered before the war.
The renewed hostilities also heightened concerns for the 137 hostages the Israeli military believes are still being held by Hamas. During the recent truce, 105 hostages were freed, and Israel released 240 Palestinian prisoners. Most of those released by both sides were women and children.
Elsewhere in the region, Lebanon's militant Hezbollah group said it struck Israeli positions near the tense Lebanon-Israel border. Eight soldiers and three civilians were wounded by Hezbollah fire in the area of Beit Hillel, army radio reported. The military said its artillery struck sources of fire from Lebanon and its fighter jets struck other Hezbollah targets.
Iraqi militants with the Iran-backed umbrella group the Islamic Resistance in Iraq said they struck the Kharab al-Jir U.S. military base in Syria with rockets. A U.S. military official, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with regulations, said rockets hit Rumalyn Landing Zone in Syria but there were no reports of casualties or damage.
Later Sunday, officials with Iranian-backed militias in Iraq said five militia members were killed in an airstrike blamed on the U.S. near Kirkuk.

A partial transcript is as follows:
LAWRENCE JONES: How difficult is it to make that contact with Hamas? Because all the American people are wondering, “where are the Americans being released?”
TREY YINGST: It’s a great question because when we talk with Hamas officials, they become increasingly frustrated throughout the war as I continue to question them over the phone and over text messages about what they did on October 7th. They have gone as far as to blatantly lie when presented with evidence because they simply don’t want to tell the truth about what took place here. We’re able to make contact and get comment from them about this ongoing conflict. But in terms of the information they’re providing, we often will not actually bring to air what they are telling us because I can’t confirm it. A lot of times, they’re lying. And so we do reach out. We try to do our due diligence on these stories and get as many perspectives and angles as possible.

Israel’s National Security Council issued new travel advice for dozens of countries amid ongoing concern for the safety of Israeli citizens travelling overseas, the Australian Financial Review reports.
Australia was included among a swath of countries for which travel advice was raised to “Level 2”, recommending Israelis take extra precautions when visiting.
The U.S. remains at Level 1, or no threat.
South Africa, Eritrea, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan are among countries that Israelis are being told to avoid. The council said threats against Jews are rising across the world:
Since the beginning of the war, there have been increased efforts identified from Iran and its affiliates, including Hamas and Islamic Jihad, to target Israelis and Jews around the world. On this basis, along with the rising levels of incitement, attempted attacks and antisemitism around the world, the National Security Council has reiterated its recommendation for Israelis to reconsider any non-essential travel at this time.
Those who do travel are being told to avoid showing any external signs identifying them as Israeli or Jewish.
A number of pro-Palestinian rallies in Australia have included antisemitic threats and abuse, including a massed gathering in Sydney two days after the October 7 Hamas terror attack where protesters chanted “Gas the Jews” amongst other slurs.

On another occasion a wild mob of pro-Palestinian demonstrators targeted a Melbourne hotel where Israeli family members of murder victims and hostages of the attack had been staying.
As Breitbart News reported, the activists, armed with flags and signs with anti-Israel messages, had tracked the Israeli supporters to their hotel in the Victorian state capital.
The protesters, some wearing Palestinian keffiyeh headscarves, unfurled signs reading “Stop Arming Israel, Free Palestine” and “Zionism is Fascism” and placed fake babies covered in blood across the hotel lobby while shouting insults through a loudspeaker.

A solemn Bondi Beach memorial dedicated to Israeli hostages being held by Hamas terrorists has also been attacked, with two men caught ripping down posters that were a key to the display.
More than 230 blue and white towels, the colors of the Israeli flag, were draped over the railings at the iconic Sydney beach along with photographs of the hostages believed to be still in Gaza, and posters, saying “Kidnapped.”
Footage emerged of two men attempting to take down posters of the hostages while being confronted by a larger group who stepped forward to challenge them.

OAKLAND — A group of Oakland teachers are planning a ""teach-in"" Wednesday that shows the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict and its history through a Palestinian perspective.
The demonstration is causing local parents to consider holding their kids back from schools during the lesson plan but not all teachers will be participating.
CBS News Bay Area obtained a Google document that details the proposed curriculum for Oakland students ages kindergarten through high school to learn about the centuries-old conflict.
""Know that our outrage is noble and just. Our power is building and you can play a big role in that,"" states a Youtube video that encourages teachers to participate.
It's not clear who created or published the video.

""It's devastating to Oakland families, especially Jewish families,"" Rabbi Dovid Labkowski of Chabad Oakland, told CBS News Bay Area. ""Education is about teaching right from wrong, morals and values, when you decide you don't like something happening in the world and you decide to put together a curriculum that's going to teach about hating other people that's what this is about, this is about hating Jews.""
He said the teach-in deepens antisemitism in a city that he says has never experienced such hate.
""What it does I think is that it means people who look Jewish will be targeted,"" Lobkowski explained. ""Antisemitism was never really a factor here in Oakland; we have one of the most diverse populations in the country. It's a great place to live, great place for families, but this antisemitism is devastating.""
The lesson plan comes from a group called OEA for Palestine. It's a group of teachers who want to use the day to teach about Palestinian liberation.
Their material and the teach-in are not backed by the Oakland school district, but local CAIR president Zahara Billoo said it presents an opportunity for current events to be taught.
""This is important this is necessary to teach kids about current events is frankly what it comes down to,"" Billoo told CBS News Bay Area.
The suggested curriculum mentions the term intifada which is an arabic word for rebellion that has often been linked to violent uprisings.
But Billoo sees the teach-in as an opportunity to promote inclusion.
""Some of the first complaints we received were of students feeling alienated and targeted at schools,"" she explained, ""so when I heard I was excited, and I thought this is a good opportunity to counter some of the misinformation about Israel.""
But for Labkowski, he believes leaving out Israel's perspective may be harmful to the Jewish community, particularly in the days before Hanukkah.
""Lighting up the world and fighting the darkness that's what Hanukkah is about,"" he said. ""It was the few against the many and that's what it's about today, kindness brings kindness, hate brings hate but positivity brings positivity.""
Oakland Unified School District superintendent Dr. Kyla Johnson-Trammell said in a statement that ""the District does not authorize this action. Furthermore, I want to make clear that the instructional materials developed and shared by the teach-in organizers are not aligned with the materials and guidance previously provided by our Chief Academic Officer, Dr. Sondra Aguilera.""",www.cbsnews.com,Planned teach-in at Oakland schools would present Palestinian perspective to students,https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/possible-teach-in-at-oakland-schools-would-present-palestinian-perspective-to-students/,en,2023-12-04 18:38:00,US,11,544,"['Hostile_encounter', 'Hostile_encounter', 'Hostile_encounter']","['ongoing', 'Israel-Hamas', 'centuries-old', 'in Gaza']"

Update: The suspect has been charged with three counts of attempted murder in the second degree. Read the latest here. Our earlier story is below.
Burlington, Vermont, police have arrested a white man who is suspected of shooting three 20-year-old college students of Palestinian descent on Saturday, police said.
The three men were in Burlington visiting the home of one of the victim's relatives for Thanksgiving, police said. They were on Prospect Street when an armed white man confronted them and, without speaking, allegedly discharged at least four rounds around 6:30 p.m. ET.
Two of the victims were shot in the torso while the third man was shot in his lower extremities, police said. Two of the victims were in what police described as stable condition. The third victim ""sustained much more serious injuries.""
Two of the victims were wearing keffiyehs, scarfs that have come to symbolize Palestinian solidarity, officials said. Police said two of the victims are U.S. citizens and one is a legal resident.
Police detained Jason J. Eaton, 48, around 3:30 p.m. Sunday, Burlington police said Sunday night.
Evidence collected during a search of Eaton's home several hours after he was detained ""gave investigators and prosecutors probable cause to believe that Mr. Eaton perpetrated the shooting,"" police said. He was then arrested and is scheduled to be arraigned Monday, police said.
Police did not immediately provide any information on a possible motive.

The U.S. Attorney's Office in Vermont on Sunday night said it was investigating to determine whether a federal crime had been committed.
""We recognize the suffering and heartbreak that the three men who were wounded, their families, and their communities are experiencing,"" Nikolas P. Kerest, U.S. Attorney for Vermont, said in a statement.
The FBI Albany field office said Sunday night it was also investigating the shooting.
President Biden on Monday said he and first lady Jill Biden were ""horrified"" by the shooting. The three young men ""were simply spending Thanksgiving gathered with family and loved ones,"" Mr. Biden wrote in a statement, adding, ""While we are waiting for more facts, we know this: there is absolutely no place for violence or hate in America. Period.""
Investigators don't know as much as they'd like, Burlington police chief Jon Murad said on Sunday. He urged the public to avoid jumping to conclusions ""based on statements from uninvolved parties who know even less.""
""In this charged moment, no one can look at this incident and not suspect that it may have been a hate-motivated crime,"" Murad said. ""And I have already been in touch with federal investigatory and prosecutorial partners to prepare for that if it's proven. But now that the victims are safe and receiving medical care, our next priority is identifying, locating, and apprehending the suspect. We're working every investigatory angle on this case, and will continue to provide reliable, factual information to public while protecting the victims and our investigation.""
Police did not identify the victims by name, but the victim's families later identified them in a statement. All three victims attended Ramallah Friends School, a Quaker-run private nonprofit school in Ramallah. Currently, Hisham Awartani is a student at Brown University, Kinnan Abdalhamid is a student at Haverford College and Tahseen Ahmad is a student at Trinity College, according to their family members.
From left to right, Tahseen Ali Ahmad, Kinnan Abdalhamid and Hisham Awartani are shown.
""As parents, we are devastated by the horrific news that our children were targeted and shot in Burlington, VT. At this time, our primary concern is their full recovery and that they receive the critical medical support they need to survive. We are extremely concerned about the safety and well-being of our children,"" the parents said in a joint statement.
""We call on law enforcement to conduct a thorough investigation, including treating this as a hate crime,"" the parents said. ""We will not be comfortable until the shooter is brought to justice. We need to ensure that our children are protected, and this heinous crime is not repeated. No family should ever have to endure this pain and agony. Our children are dedicated students who deserve to be able to focus on their studies and building their futures.""
Awartani's uncle, Rich Price, told CBS Boston station WBZ-TV the three students were spending the holiday weekend with his family in Burlington when it happened.
""We were so happy to have them visit us for Thanksgiving,"" said Price.
""They grew up in the occupied West Bank under military control... they just couldn't imagine this could happen in a place like Vermont,"" he said. He told the station the thee students had gone for a walk in the neighborhood Saturday after returning from an 8th birthday party for Price's twin boys.
""They were approached by this individual who pulled a handgun on them and shot all three of them,"" Price said.
Haverford's president and dean shared a joint statement about the shooting on Sunday.
""Kinnan and his friends are all Palestinian students studying at U.S. colleges and universities,"" they wrote. ""Police are investigating the shootings, and we await word on whether it will be pursued as a hate crime.""
Trinity's president and vice president also shared a joint statement, saying they were ""heartbroken"" to learn Ahmad was one of the victims of gun violence.
""A member of the Trinity Student Life staff went to Vermont early this morning to provide support and reports that Tahseen wants the Trinity community to know that he is in stable condition at an area hospital, and that he is aware this message is being released,"" they wrote.
Awartani remained hospitalized Sunday, Brown University President Christina H. Paxson said in a statement. He is expected to survive his injuries.
""There are not enough words to express the deep anguish I feel for Hisham, his parents and family members, and his friends. I know that this heinous and despicable act of violence — this latest evidence of anti-Arab and anti-Palestinian discrimination and hate spiraling across this country and around the world — will leave many in our community deeply shaken,"" Paxson said. ""The family has given us permission to share that Hisham Awartani, a junior at Brown, remains hospitalized, and we were very relieved and grateful to learn that he is expected to survive his injuries.""
The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee said it has ""reason to believe this shooting occurred because the victims are Arab.""
""We are praying for a full recovery of the victims, and will stand by to support the families in any way that is needed,"" said ADC National Executive Director Abed Ayoub. ""Given the information collected and provided, it is clear that the hate was a motivating factor in this shooting, and we call on law enforcement to investigate it as such. The surge in anti-Arab and anti-Palestinian sentiment we are experiencing is unprecedented, and this is another example of that hate turning violent.""
A White House official on Sunday said President Biden had been briefed on the shooting.
Sen. Bernie Sanders responded to the shooting in a post on social media.
""It is shocking and deeply upsetting that three young Palestinians were shot here in Burlington, VT,"" he said. ""Hate has no place here, or anywhere. I look forward to a full investigation. My thoughts are with them and their families.""

106,The Ventura County Sheriff's Department has arrested computer science professor and pro-Palestinian protester Loay Alnaji in the death of Jewish man Paul Kessler.,"Police have arrested a pro-Palestinian California college professor in the death of a 69-year-old Jewish man at concurrent pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian demonstrations on Nov. 5.
Loay Abdelfattah Alnaji, 50, was taken into custody on Thursday, charged with involuntary manslaughter and battery causing great body injury and incarcerated at Ventura County Jail on $1,000,000 bail, according to a Ventura County Sheriff's Department press release. Both charges have ""special allegations that Alnaji personally inflicted great bodily injury,"" the release said.
""We're not providing any additional information at this moment in time, however there will be additional information released later today,"" Sgt. Rob Yoos told Fox News Digital on Thursday morning.
Investigators with the department allege that Alnaji caused pro-Israel protester Paul Kessler to knock his head onto the concrete when he fell, which resulted in brain hemorrhaging that would kill him hours later in the hospital.

Although police previously obtained a warrant to search Alnaji's vehicle and home in Moorpark on Nov. 6, detaining the then-suspect for about two hours, they had insufficient evidence to carry out an arrest.
It is unclear what new evidence led to Alnaji's arrest. In the weeks preceding his arrest, some witnesses have told Fox News Digital that the pro-Palestinian protester struck Kessler with his megaphone. An autopsy carried out by Ventura County Medical Examiner Christopher Young showed minor abrasions to the left side of Kessler's mouth in addition to the brain swelling and bruising that killed him.
The Ventura County Sheriff's Department and District Attorney's office have scheduled a press conference Friday on the investigation, the agencies said.

The department wrote that they are still crowdsourcing photos and video from 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. at the intersections of Westlake and Thousand Oaks Boulevards, and offering a $1,000 reward for any pertinent footage or information.
Alnaji is a full-time professor teaching computer science at Ventura County Community College's Moorpark campus. The school did not immediately return Fox News Digital's request for comment.
He was born in Kuwait, according to the Ventura County District Attorney's office. His citizenship status is not currently clear.

ELDERLY JEWISH MAN DIED IN CONFRONTATION WITH PRO-PALESTINIAN PROTESTER AT CALIFORNIA RALLY
On his now-deleted Instagram, Alnaji reposted a video in which activist Shahid King Bolsen compares the Hamas terrorist group to civil rights leaders Nelson Mandela and Mahatma Gandhi:
""If someone asked me to condemn Hamas I would say, what's the rush?"" Bolsen said in the video Alnaji shared. ""Let's let history decide.""

""Let's wait to see because you might change your mind on this, too — you condemned Mahatma Gandhi until you didn't,"" Bolsen said in the video shared by Alnaji.
In footage capturing the aftermath of the altercation between Alnaji and Kessler, the latter man can be seen bleeding on the ground.
Alnaji sits feet away on a curb, and can be seen answering a police officer's questions. At a press conference on Nov. 7, Ventura County Sheriff James Fryhoff said that the then-unnamed suspect was cooperative.
Later, Alnaji can be seen looking on as Kessler is pulled into a waiting ambulance on a gurney.

BEIT HANINA AL-BALAD, Israeli-Occupied West Bank — Fatima Abu Dahouk sits on her porch on a rocky hillside in the rain, ruing the day in 1948 that her grandparents fled the farm that had been in their family for centuries, in what is now southern Israel.
""They thought they were leaving for only a month, maybe two,"" says Abu Dahouk, a 36-year-old mother of four. ""But promises were broken.""
They were never allowed back. Nor were the vast majority of Palestinians who fled or were expelled when Israel was created. Their homes were destroyed or given to Jewish refugees. Few, if any, received compensation for the loss of their land and property. Amnesty International says Israel has failed to recognize their right under international law to return to their land.
""We still have land deeds that data back to the Ottoman era,"" says Abu Dahouk's husband, Sakher Abu Dahouk, 56, whose relatives hail from the same area.
Since 1948, his extended family has moved several times — from what is now Beer Sheva, Israel, to Jordan, to the Israeli-occupied West Bank — as Israel seized territory in subsequent wars, redrew boundaries and built more Jewish settlements.

That first displacement in 1948 set off a chain reaction — like dominoes falling, Fatima says — which has landed her here: A cinderblock house wedged between a sheep pen and a dry riverbed, behind a section of giant concrete barrier Israel built in 2002 after the second Palestinian intifada uprising.
Over the past three months, the vast majority of Palestinians in Gaza — some 2 million people — have been internally displaced by war, according to the United Nations. Some members of Israel's government want them to leave Gaza altogether.
But family histories like the Abu Dahouks' are why that idea hits such a nerve. It evokes the trauma of an earlier displacement that has become part of what it means to be Palestinian. That displacement reverberates through Palestinian music, culture and art. And it explains why people in Gaza — many, or perhaps most of whom have seen their homes destroyed — may refuse to relocate outside the Gaza Strip, even temporarily.
What Israeli officials have said about relocating Palestinians
In November, two Israeli lawmakers published an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal calling for ""countries around the world to accept limited numbers of Gazan families who have expressed a desire to relocate."" (The authors, current members of Israel's parliament, are from two different political parties. Danny Danon, from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing Likud Party, is a former Israeli ambassador to the U.N.; Ram Ben-Barak, from a centrist political party called Yesh Atid, is a former director of Israel's Mossad spy agency.)
The idea of ""voluntary migration"" of Palestinians from Gaza — defined as the resettlement abroad of those who are willing — has gained traction with at least two members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's governing coalition.
""We have to further the solution of supporting the migration of Gazan residents,"" Israel's national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, told a Jan. 3 news conference. ""It is a correct, just, moral, and humane solution.""
Israel's finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, has also expressed support for the large-scale transfer of civilians from Gaza. Last month, he told Israeli media that the removal of around 90% of Palestinians from the area would make Israel safer.
""If there are 100,000 or 200,000 Arabs in Gaza and not 2 million, the whole discourse about the day after [the war ends] will be different,"" Smotrich was quoted as saying.
The U.S. State Department has called these comments ""inflammatory and irresponsible."" Both Smotrich and Ben-Gvir also live in West Bank settlements that the U.N. and U.S. consider to be illegally built on Palestinian land.
Netanyahu has distanced himself from his ministers' statements.
""Israel has no intention of permanently occupying Gaza or displacing its civilian population,"" he said in a video statement Jan. 10.

What Palestinians in Gaza want
Civilians in Gaza, for their part, are just struggling to survive. Gaza health officials say more than 24,000 people have been killed in Israel's military operation in the Gaza Strip over the past three months, since the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack that Israel says killed 1,200 people. The United Nations warns famine is imminent.
But many Palestinians say they've heard about Ben-Gvir and Smotrich's statements — and are alarmed.
""We refuse to allow history to repeat itself,"" Zakaria Basouni, 55, told NPR on Jan. 14 in Rafah, Gaza's southernmost city.
Basouni fled bombing in northern Gaza and was taking refuge in Rafah, which has absorbed more than 1 million internally displaced people since Oct. 7. He said he's determined not to flee any farther south to Egypt, even if the border opens.
He said he'd rather die in Gaza than leave his land.
""We've been evicted from our homes under fire,"" another evacuee from northern Gaza, 27-year-old Mohammed Subeh, told NPR in Rafah on the same day. ""It's just like our ancestors always told us, about how they lived in safety until they were suddenly dispersed to different countries.""
""I won't let it happen to my family again,"" Subeh said.
Aid agencies may have a dilemma
Even with many, perhaps most, of the residential buildings in Gaza destroyed, many Palestinians fear exile more than anything.
So even if aid agencies were to explore temporarily transferring Gaza's civilians abroad — either to keep them safe while Israel fights Hamas or to house them while rebuilding Gaza after the war — that prospect is likely to face fierce opposition from Palestinians themselves.
The U.N.'s humanitarian coordinator, Martin Griffiths, said Jan. 12 that some countries have ""offered to host civilians who want to leave Gaza, for their protection."" He didn't specify which countries.
Israeli media, citing unnamed sources, report that members of Netanyahu's government have held secret talks with officials from the Democratic Republic of Congo and other countries to discuss their possible willingness to absorb Palestinian refugees from Gaza. Congolese officials denied the reports, as did an Israeli official.
A British think tank run by former Prime Minister Tony Blair also denied as a ""lie"" an Israeli TV report that Blair met Netanyahu in late December to discuss a role in resettling Palestinians from Gaza.
The U.N.'s Griffiths says he's ""alarmed"" by any talk of transferring Palestinians out of Gaza.
""These statements [by Israeli ministers] raise grave concerns about the possible forcible mass transfer or deportation of the Palestinian population from the Gaza Strip, something that would be strictly prohibited under international law,"" Griffiths told the Security Council.

Some Palestinians have been refugees for 76 years
In 1948, and again in 1967, Palestinians displaced from their lands were resettled in U.N. refugee camps in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. These areas are still dotted with camps, and they no longer feel temporary.
In fact, they're mostly indistinguishable from the urban streets around them. Palestinian refugee camps house schools, markets, mosques and U.N. offices. In the Al-Am'ari camp in the West Bank capital Ramallah, narrow passageways are spraypainted with graffiti celebrating Hamas and other militant groups.
That's where Mohammed Suleiman Khader, 84, has lived for 76 years — since he was 8 years old. He was born in an Arab village called Al-Na'ani, south of what is now Tel Aviv.
""I remember the Zionist gangs coming to our village, pressuring us to leave. We were the last family to go,"" Khader recalls, paging through an atlas of depopulated Arab villages. ""I remember it like yesterday. We left at 5 p.m., with our bedding on our backs.""
Enlarge this image toggle caption Ayman Oghanna for NPR Ayman Oghanna for NPR
The village was destroyed after his family left, he says. He couldn't go back.
""I still remember the watermelons we grew in our garden,"" Khader says, smiling.
He says his parents died with regrets that they didn't insist on staying on their land — come what may.
It's what many Palestinians in Gaza are weighing now, Khader says.
""What we felt then, our people are feeling again now,"" he says.

Wasim Haq, who had already been serving a suspension for the inflammatory November 11 post, officially resigned on Thursday.
In the post, which Haq deleted, he wrote, “Netanyahu has sacrificed his own people to maintain power…whilst #Palestinians are trying to maintain their sanity. Adolf Hitler would be proud of Benjamin Netanyahu.”
In a subsequent post, Haq denied being an antisemite.
In his resignation, Haq chalked his post up to “heightened emotions.”
“It is with great sadness that I inform you of my decision to resign as a member of the FA Council with immediate effect,” Haq said.
“As someone who has worked closely with many Jewish people over the years and created meaningful and valued friendships, the most painful part of this process is knowing that some of those friends and colleagues may not forgive me for the misunderstanding and hurt I have unintentionally caused. I take full responsibility and reiterate my apology to them and all those affected.”
Haq says that the real target of his post was Netanyahu, not the Israeli people.
“In expressing those feelings, I chose the wrong words entirely and that has impacted the leadership position that I hold at the FA,” he explained.
“Following the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas there are heightened emotions all around. I, like millions of others, have been deeply disturbed by the huge loss of life, this war has become a painful slaughter of innocent adults and children – a war that humanity should have avoided.”
In addition to his resignation, “Haq has also been sacked from his role as an independent councilor at the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA), the national governing body of tennis in Great Britain, while he is also being investigated by England Golf, where he holds a role similar to that at the FA,” Reuters reports.",www.breitbart.com,English Soccer Exec Resigns After Posting 'Hitler Would Be Proud of Benjamin Netanyahu',https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2023/11/23/english-soccer-exec-resigns-after-posting-hitler-would-be-proud-of-benjamin-netanyahu/,en,2023-11-24 03:35:03,US,13,330,"['Quantified_mass', 'Attack', 'Hostile_encounter', 'Hostile_encounter', 'Firing']","['many', 'Jewish people', 'Oct. 7', 'by Hamas', 'that humanity should have avoided', 'Haq', 'from his role as an independent councilor at the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA), the national governing body of tennis in Great Britain']"

Enlarge this image toggle caption James Manning/AP James Manning/AP
LONDON — Former British Prime Minister David Cameron made an unexpected return to high office on Monday, becoming foreign secretary in a major shakeup of the Conservative government that also saw the firing of divisive Home Secretary Suella Braverman.
Cameron, who led the U.K. government between 2010 and 2016 and triggered the country's exit from the European Union, was appointed by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in a Cabinet shuffle in which he sacked Braverman, a law-and-order hardliner who drew anger for accusing police of being too lenient with pro-Palestinian protesters.
She was replaced by James Cleverly, who had been foreign secretary. Sunak was making further changes to the government throughout the day, with Environment Secretary Therese Coffey saying she would be leaving her job.
The bold changes are an attempt by Sunak to reset his faltering government. The Conservatives have been in power for 13 years, but opinion polls for months have put them 15 to 20 points behind the opposition Labour Party amid a stagnating economy, persistently high inflation, an overstretched health care system and a wave of public sector strikes.
Cameron's appointment came as a surprise to seasoned politics-watchers. It's rare for a non-lawmaker to take a senior government post, and it has been decades since a former prime minister held a Cabinet job.
The government said Cameron had been appointed to Parliament's unelected upper chamber, the House of Lords. The last foreign secretary to serve in the Lords, rather than the elected House of Commons, was Peter Carrington, who was part of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government in the 1980s.
Cameron, 57, said Britain was ""facing a daunting set of international challenges, including the war in Ukraine and the crisis in the Middle East.""
""While I have been out of front-line politics for the last seven years, I hope that my experience — as Conservative leader for 11 years and prime minister for six — will assist me in helping the prime minister to meet these vital challenges,"" he said in a statement.
Cameron's foreign policy legacy is mixed. As prime minister he backed NATO-led military intervention in Libya in 2011 that toppled Moammar Gadhafi and deepened that country's chaos. In 2013, he tried and failed to gain Parliament's backing for U.K. airstrikes against President Bashar al-Assad's forces in Syria. He also announced a short-lived ""golden era"" in U.K.-China relations, shortly before that relationship soured.
And he will be forever remembered as the unwitting author of Brexit, a rupture that roiled Britain's politics, economy and place in the world. Cameron called a 2016 EU membership referendum, confident the country would vote to stay in the bloc. He resigned the day after voters opted to leave.
Enlarge this image toggle caption Maja Smiejkowska/AP Maja Smiejkowska/AP
Bronwen Maddox, director of international affairs think-tank Chatham House, said Cameron ""will bring undoubted strengths into the top team and to the U.K.'s relationships abroad,"" where many will welcome ""a heavyweight and moderate foreign secretary.""
""The concern must be, however, that these could be outweighed by the controversial legacy he brings too,"" she said.
Sunak was a strong backer of the winning ""leave"" side in the referendum. But his decision to appoint Cameron and sack Braverman is likely to infuriate the Conservative Party's right wing and inflame tensions in the party that Sunak has sought to soothe.
Prominent right-wing lawmaker Jacob Rees-Mogg said sacking Braverman was ""a mistake, because Suella understood what the British voter thought and was trying to do something about it.""
Sunak had been under growing pressure to fire Braverman — a hard-liner popular with the party's authoritarian wing — from one of the most senior jobs in government, responsible for handling immigration and policing.
In a highly unusual attack on the police last week, Braverman said London's police force was ignoring lawbreaking by ""pro-Palestinian mobs."" She described demonstrators calling for a cease-fire in Gaza as ""hate marchers.""
Enlarge this image toggle caption Alastair Grant/AP Alastair Grant/AP
On Saturday, far-right protesters scuffled with police and tried to confront a large pro-Palestinian march by hundreds of thousands through the streets of London. Critics accused Braverman of helping to inflame tensions.
Last week, Braverman wrote an article for the Times of London in which she said police ""play favorites when it comes to protesters"" and acted more leniently toward pro-Palestinian demonstrators and Black Lives Matter supporters than toward right-wing protesters or soccer hooligans.
The article was not approved in advance by the prime minister's office, as would usually be the case.
Braverman said Monday that ""it has been the greatest privilege of my life to serve as home secretary,"" adding that she would ""have more to say in due course.""
Braverman, a 43-year-old lawyer, has become a leader of the party's populist wing by advocating ever-tougher curbs on migration and a war on human rights protections, liberal social values and what she has called the ""tofu-eating wokerati."" Last month she called migration a ""hurricane"" that would bring ""millions more immigrants to these shores, uncontrolled and unmanageable.""
As home secretary, Braverman championed the government's stalled plan to send asylum-seekers who arrive in Britain in boats on a one-way trip to Rwanda. A U.K. Supreme Court ruling on whether the policy is legal is due on Wednesday.
Critics say Braverman has been building her profile to position herself for a party leadership contest that could come if the Conservatives lose power in an election expected next year.
Last month Sunak tried to paint his government as a force of change, saying he would break a ""30-year status quo"" that includes the governments of Cameron and other Conservative predecessors.
""A few weeks ago, Rishi Sunak said David Cameron was part of a failed status quo. Now he's bringing him back as his life raft,"" said Labour lawmaker Pat McFadden.
As well as bringing about Brexit, Cameron's government imposed years of public-spending cuts after the 2008 global financial crisis that have frayed the country's welfare system and state-funded health service. After leaving office he was caught up in a scandal over his lobbying for Greensill Capital, a financial services firm that later collapsed.
Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London, said Cameron's appointment was a sign of the government's ""desperation.""

101,"Carlton Reid is still managing to make a living as a travel writer, despite a self-imposed flight ban.
His last flight was in March 2020 - and he's managed to keep his head above water ever since.","Last week, I turned down a luscious invite to Abu Dhabi, complete with a business-class flight and a five-star hotel. Was I mad? Yes, mad about runaway climate change, and so, despite being a travel writer, I’ve stopped flying.
Being a travel writer that doesn’t fly is deemed so exotic that I was the second story on Monday’s As It Happens, a 55-year-old radio news show aired by Canada’s national broadcaster.
The incredulous CBC host asked me when I’d quit. It was a decision brought on by the pandemic, I replied.
My last flight was in March 2020, returning from Israel on a group press trip to Palestine. As we landed at Heathrow, and our phones started pinging with the latest news, I remember talking, incredulously, about the likelihood of lockdowns with my fellow travel writers. Days later came the first stay-at-home order, and I, like many other people, started maxing out credit cards to survive: no travel, no articles, no cash.
Pivoting to other forms of journalism — including reporting on the Covid-19 bicycle boom and its likely post-pandemic crash — I kept my head above water.
Travel writer Carlton Reid (above) last flew in March 2020. Now he travels everywhere by bike, train and electric car
When flight restrictions were gradually lifted, many people - including travel writers — were desperate to fly again, but I wasn’t so fussed. It wasn’t fear of travelling in a 500-mile-per-hour aluminium tube in close proximity to loosely masked coughing passengers - it was the fear of a heating planet.
For solid scientific reasons, I’d felt guilty about air travel for some time.
Our average CO2 output in the UK is roughly 10 tonnes a year per person, and we need to aim for lower than five tonnes per year.
Our family has an electric car powered by rooftop solar panels, and I usually cycle rather than drive, so there’s little fat to trim from my domestic travel.
Quitting flying led to an immediate and significant drop in my carbon emissions.
I still travel to exotic locations. As reported in the Mail, I’ve taken high-speed trains and ferries to Malta and Ibiza.
When I travelled to the recent Champion’s League match between Paris St. Germain and Newcastle United, I took the LNER train to London from the North East, linking up with the Eurostar to reach the City of Light.
According to Eurostar, this journey’s London to Paris leg used 2.4kgs of CO2 per person. Flying between the capitals emits 66kgs per person. Taking the train reduces emissions by a whopping 96 per cent. In the Netherlands, the Eurostar to Amsterdam is powered by electricity entirely generated from wind, and in the UK, that figure is 40 per cent and rising.
Carlton explains that when he travelled to the recent Champion’s League match between Paris St. Germain and Newcastle United, he took an LNER train to London from the North East, linking up with the Eurostar to reach the City of Light
Understandably, the availability of cheap flights makes it a no-brainer for most people to travel by air, but there’s still a cost, and that cost — measured in CO2 emissions — is helping to fuel climate change. We need to reduce our annual emissions, and while not everybody will ever go full hairshirt by becoming flight-free, more long-distance travel can and should be done over the ground.
It’ll take longer to get to Australia, but there’s no Planet B.

'They killed babies. They raped women. They burnt people alive. They filmed it all. A massacre which you were completely silent about.'
Grant previously called out Lineker for his response to the attack by Hamas on Israel back in November.
He slammed Lineker for remaining 'silent' and insisted his respect for the ex-England striker had 'gone'.
The deadly attack saw over 1,200 people killed and 250 kidnapped, but Lineker did not issue a statement condemning it, and instead tweeted about his former club Tottenham on the same day.
Grant accused Lineker of having a 'double standard', referring to how he has not been afraid to voice his opinion on global affairs in the past.
Lineker was stood down from Match of the Day presenting duties last March after comparing the language used by then-Home Secretary Suella Braverman when talking about migration to that used in 1930s Germany.
He was reinstated just days later following public backlash, but Grant claimed the October 7 attacks were comparable to German policy in the 1930s and was angered that Lineker did not show support for Israel.
'I follow Gary, he comments about everything, he even said that the current policy of the UK Government reminded him of the policy of the German government in the 1930s,' Grant said.
Lineker tweeted about Tottenham on October 7 but did not post about the attack on Israel by Hamas

104,Sen. Ted Cruz is blaming the far-left's takeover of American universities for the 'pervasive' censorship of conservatives and the spread of Marxist ideals.,"Sen. Ted Cruz is blaming the far-left's takeover of American universities for the 'pervasive' censorship of conservatives and the spread of Marxist ideals.
'We've seen censorship is pervasive. And it is one of the many tools that is used by the extreme left,' Cruz told DailyMail.com during an exclusive interview.
He was reacting to a bombshell new report that revealed government agencies worked with Stanford University and other colleges to create a 'disinformation group' to censor speech leading up to the 2020 election.
According to new emails, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and State Department worked with colleges to label posts by former President Donald Trump, Republican Rep. Thomas Massie and Sen. Thom Tillis and conservative news commentators as 'misinformation.'
Cruz told DailyMail.com that one of the main reasons he wrote his new book 'Unwoke,' which was released this week, was because of the leftist radicalization of colleges nationwide.
'The reason I wrote the book is millions of us are looking around wondering what the hell happened. How did things get so extreme so quickly?' Cruz said.
A bombshell new report revealed government agencies worked with Stanford University (pictured) and other colleges to create a 'disinformation group' to censor speech leading up to the 2020 election
Cruz discussed his new book 'Unwoke' exclusively with DailyMail.com
'What the book describes is how the extreme left seized control of the major institutions of our country and it started with universities.'
The Republican senator from Texas mentioned other recent instances where Stanford has allowed radicalism on its campus.
Federal Appellate Judge Stuart Kyle Duncan came to Stanford Law School in March 2023 and was screamed at, cursed and harassed by a group of students who didn't agree with his conservative viewpoint.
It was in a way 'that was unimaginable,' said Cruz. 'And, and that's one of many instances we've seen it the radicalization in universities.'
The senator said the issue has only intensified in the wake of the Hamas terrorist attacks on Israel on October 7, killing over 1,400 innocent civilians.
University student groups have written letters in support of Hamas, organized rallies in support of Palestine and engaged in antisemitic behavior.
Stanford leadership has come under scrutiny for failing to quickly condemn Hamas' brutal attack on Israel and for not hitting back at antisemitism on its campus.
In addition, there have been several 'hatred and antisemitism' incidents at Stanford, including the tearing down of posters of civilians taken hostage by Hamas and chalk graffiti.
Over a thousand students and graduates signed an open letter to Stanford rebuking the university for failing to quickly respond.
The university ended up suspending one of its teachers for calling out Israeli students while addressing the slaughter in Israel.
'Sunshine and transparency' are the most powerful weapons to fight back against the growing Marxism on college campuses, Cruz told DailyMail.com.
He said in the case of the appellate judge being shouted down by student protestors, he wrote to the dean of the law school and Stanford's president and called on them to terminate Tirien Steinbach, the 'DEI Dean who sided with the mob instead of the speaker and the judge.'
Indeed, Stanford ended up terminating her because 'the agenda of the extreme left is not popular.'
In addition, the chief justice of the Texas Supreme Court wrote to Cruz, telling him the Texas State Bar was implementing 'enhanced scrutiny' especially for graduates of Stanford and also Yale Law School.
Cruz said he supports efforts taken by top law firms around the country who have pledged not to hire any students who participated in pro-Hamas rallies on their campuses.
He also stated that major donors of the schools are rightfully pulling massive amounts of money from them because they have become 'such a hotbed of antisemitism.'
What's happening on college campuses currently is 'a perfect example' of what his book is about, he continued.
'I describe it as cultural Marxism,' he explained.

The Marxist lens has been applied to critical race theory, gender orientation and other issues, the senator said.
He also brought up China's infiltration into the American education system, which he called the 'nexus that connects all of the woke institutions.'
The senator referred to a laboratory in Montana where taxpayer money was used to manipulate coronaviruses before the pandemic.
DailyMail.com revealed last week how government-sponsored researchers infected bats with a 'SARS-like' virus in 2018 as part of a collaboration with the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which is at the center of the COVID cover-up scandal.
In addition, TikTok is perpetuating the issue on college campuses, Cruz believes.
The company is pushing 'very harmful content, particularly to kids' which he says is 'promoting abuse and all sorts of dangerous activities by young people.'
It is also 'very deliberately promoting pro-Hamas propaganda,' he said.
Cruz added that we're seeing an increase in extremism from the left - whether it's the progressive Squad in the House of Representatives or in the 'vicious, anti-Israel, antisemitic protests on campuses with Jewish students.'
Squad Rep. Rashida Tlaib was censured by her colleagues in the House Tuesday evening for her anti-Israel rhetoric.
The reprimand came after Tlaib defended use of a rallying cry used by Palestinian militants - 'from the river to the sea.'
The resolution called out Tlaib for 'continuing to knowingly spread the false narrative that Israel intentionally bombed' a hospital in Gaza.
Israeli intelligence claimed the hospital explosion, that killed dozens, was caused by a Hamas rocket misfire.

105,Conditions deteriorating rapidly and healthcare particularly badly hit as bombing and fighting continues,"Doctors and aid workers in Gaza say they have been abandoned by the international community to a “humanitarian tragedy” as they “fight to survive” after almost four weeks of war between Israel and Hamas.
With widespread destruction in urban areas and basic services collapsing amid continuing airstrikes, artillery bombardments and close-quarters fighting, little remains of the former lives of the 2.3 million inhabitants of the territory, said many of those who spoke to the Guardian.
Israel has placed Gaza under a near-total blockade since it launched its effort to destroy Hamas after the murderous attacks by the Palestinian militants in southern Israel on 7 October that killed 1,400 people, mostly civilians. Hamas also seized more than 240 hostages, including infants and elderly people.
Power, food and clean water has become increasingly difficult to find, while an almost total lack of fuel has emptied Gaza’s usually busy roads and stopped many generators.
At least 9,227 Palestinians have been killed since the Israeli offensive began, including 3,826 children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. It is unclear how many of the dead were combatants.
“It is a terrible situation, a real catastrophe … We feel totally abandoned, left alone, left by ourselves,” said Dr Shawqi Muhaisen, a well-known neurologist in Gaza.
Conditions inside the UN-run schools and compounds where about 700,000 people have sought shelter are deteriorating rapidly. Witnesses report acute overcrowding, the spread of infectious diseases, inadequate washing facilities and limited water.
Healthcare has been particularly badly hit. One UN administrator described hiring a donkey cart to search the few pharmacies that remained open for vital medicine for his sick 76-year-old mother.
00:01:30 'We can't take it': journalist breaks down on air reporting colleague's death in Gaza – video
“It was dangerous because of the airstrikes, but you do what you have to do for your loved ones,” said the administrator, who was not authorised to talk to the media.
An NGO worker in northern Gaza, where the most intense bombing and fighting has been taking place, described a similar frantic search to find a doctor to treat an elderly relative and then for clean syringes.
“All the hospitals were overflowing with casualties from the airstrikes. I saw appalling scenes. Children with their faces covered in blood, mothers crying as they searched for their children, fathers carrying their daughters and crying like babies,” said Mahmoud Shalabi, a programme manager in Beit Lahiya for the UK-based charity Medical Aid for Palestinians.
More than a third of Gaza’s hospitals are no longer functioning, putting remaining facilities under massive pressure. There are reports of operations carried out by torchlight, without anaesthetic and with vinegar used as a disinfectant.
Muhaisen, 54, said he had abandoned hope of ever treating hundreds of patients who depended on him for vital care as his clinic, equipment and home had all been destroyed. In the compound at Khan Younis, where he was sheltering with his family, 24 toilets served an estimated 22,000 people.
“It is a terrible situation, a real catastrophe, there is a shortage of medicine. We have to queue for hours for the toilet. I am restricting what I eat and drink so I don’t have to go to the bathroom,” he said.

Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, arrived in Tel Aviv on Friday to meet Israel’s war cabinet and urge greater restraint in its campaign to destroy Hamas.
An Israeli military spokesperson said on Friday that the aim of the offensive was to eradicate the political and military capabilities of Hamas and ensure that no repeat of the 7 October attacks was possible.
“This will take as long as it will take,” said Lt Col Richard Hecht, who accused Hamas of deliberately placing rocket launch sites next to UN-run schools and stockpiling precious fuel.
In an attempt to justify its refusal to allow fuel into Gaza, the Israeli army released a recording of a conversation that it said featured a Hamas health ministry official who admitted that the organisation kept fuel stockpiles beneath Shifa hospital in Gaza City.
Though 68 trucks carrying medical and other supplies entered the enclave on Thursday, conditions across Gaza continued to deteriorate.
Yasmin Sharraf, 37, told the Guardian she had sought shelter three weeks ago at a UN-run vocational training compound outside Khan Younis after fleeing her home in Gaza City.
“It is very horrible. It is a very crowded place. My kids are very sick with chickenpox and some respiratory infection but I cannot get them proper care,” Sharraf said. “We are all sleeping in our car together so now I am sick too.”
Periodic shutdowns by Israel, lack of power and damage from bombing has rendered much of the communications network inoperable, residents said.
“We felt totally isolated. It was really a torture. And I couldn’t connect with the rest of the family. We try to check on each other all the time. When we finally got through, my wife was crying with relief,” said one journalist who moved from Gaza City to Nuseirat refugee camp at the beginning of the conflict.
“We were really worried, we were thinking is this the end, do they want to isolate the place to do what they want without anybody hearing.”
The Israeli army said airstrikes across Gaza had targeted Hamas military command centres hidden in civilian area and that sometimes ambulances were used by Hamas to transport its fighters.
There are widespread concerns over the mental health of children and that of their parents, too. In the compound in Khan Younis, a UN administrator said he had told his young children that they had left home to go camping, hiding the truth that the house he and they had grown up in was in ruins.
“Now they just say they want to sleep in their own beds and cry all the time. I don’t know what to say any more,” said the administrator, who requested anonymity.
Others said they had not told their children about relatives and friends who had been killed or badly injured in an effort to spare them further trauma and fear.
“They ask me when it is going to be over and I tell them all things come to an end,” the UN administrator said. His uncle and several cousins were killed two weeks ago.
Muhaisen, the neurologist, said he dreaded the coming days. “Nobody cares truly about human rights. There is lots of talk but then no one takes any action. No one cares … We have no hope. I think the worst is still to come,” he said.",www.theguardian.com,‘We feel totally abandoned’: doctors and aid workers fight to survive in Gaza,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/03/doctors-and-aid-workers-fight-to-survive-in-gaza-abandoned,en,2023-11-03 14:50:03,UK,13,1088,"['Hostile_encounter', 'Destroying', 'Attack', 'Attack', 'Hostile_encounter', 'Quantified_mass', 'Destroying', 'Killing', 'Attack', 'Killing', 'Quantified_mass', 'Killing', 'Attack', 'Buildings', 'Quantified_mass', 'Death', 'Attack', 'Hostile_encounter', 'Buildings', 'Attack', 'Buildings', 'Quantified_mass', 'Buildings', 'Destroying', 'Buildings', 'Destroying', 'Buildings', 'Attack', 'Hostile_encounter', 'Destroying', 'Attack', 'Attack', 'Buildings', 'Buildings', 'Attack', 'Hostile_encounter', 'Attack', 'Buildings', 'Killing', 'Killing']","['between Israel and Hamas', 'widespread', 'in urban areas', 'artillery', 'close-quarters', 'many', 'of those who spoke to the Guardian', 'it', 'Hamas', 'after the murderous attacks by the Palestinian militants in southern Israel on 7 October that killed 1,400 people, mostly civilians', 'attacks by the Palestinian militants in southern Israel on 7 October', 'murderous', 'by the Palestinian militants', 'in southern Israel', 'on 7 October', 'that', '1,400 people', 'many', 'generators', 'At least 9,227 Palestinians', 'since the Israeli offensive began', 'Israeli', 'shelter', 'few', 'pharmacies', ""colleague's"", 'in Gaza', 'hospitals', 'hospitals', 'hundreds', 'of patients who depended on him for vital care', 'home', 'his clinic, equipment and home', 'toilet', 'building in Khan Younis', 'after Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip', 'building', 'in Khan Younis', 'Israeli', 'on the Gaza Strip', 'its campaign', 'Hamas', '7 October', 'hospital', 'in Gaza City', 'home', 'across Gaza', 'house', 'he and they', 'who', 'His uncle and several cousins', 'two weeks ago']"
106,Sir Mark Rowley says there is insufficient intelligence pointing to a risk of serious public disorder,"The Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, has defied calls for a ban on a pro-Palestinian march through London on Armistice Day as he insisted on the independence of his force amid intense government pressure to act.
In a statement in which he acknowledged the demands for him to stop Saturday’s procession, Rowley insisted there was currently insufficient intelligence that there would be a risk of serious public disorder.
He stressed the importance of an “independent police service … focused simply on the law and the facts in front of us”, despite a chorus of cabinet ministers – including the home secretary and the justice secretary – insisting that the march should not go ahead.
While vowing “at all costs” to stop any disruption linked to the march, which falls on 11 November when the nation will hold a two-minute silence in commemoration of those who have died in conflict, Rowley said he would not act outside the law.
Under section 13 of the 1986 Public Order Act, a chief constable can apply to the home secretary to prohibit public processions to avoid serious public disorder.
Rowley said: “Many have called for us to use this power to ban a planned march by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign on Saturday.
“But the use of this power is incredibly rare and must be based on intelligence which suggests there will be a real threat of serious disorder and no other way for police to manage the event …
“Over recent weeks we’ve seen an escalation of violence and criminality by small groups attaching themselves to demonstrations, despite some key organisers working positively with us.
“But at this time, the intelligence surrounding the potential for serious disorder this weekend does not meet the threshold to apply for a ban.
“The organisers have shown complete willingness to stay away from the Cenotaph and Whitehall and have no intention of disrupting the nation’s remembrance events. Should this change, we’ve been clear we will use powers and conditions available to us to protect locations and events of national importance at all costs.”
Those attending the pro-Palestine marches in recent weeks have been calling for a ceasefire in the war that broke out last month after Hamas killed 1,400 people, mainly civilians, in Israel and took more than 200 hostages.
Thousands of civilians in Gaza have been killed in the Israeli military operation since, according to Gaza’s health authority, which is run by Hamas.
Saturday’s protest is scheduled to start at 12.45pm at Marble Arch and end at the US embassy in south-west London, about two miles from the Cenotaph, where formal remembrance events will be held the next day.
The police chief’s stance is likely to provoke anger in government where there had been an expectation that Rowley would ask the home secretary, Suella Braverman, for permission to prohibit the march. Ministers had been raising the prospect of disorder for days.
The Campaign Against Antisemitism on Tuesday night called for the home secretary to trigger draconian powers and even send in the army to “uphold the values that our country stands for”.
In a letter to Braverman, the group called on her to use powers under section 40 of the Police Act 1996 to ensure that this weekend’s protests are banned. The section allows the home secretary to step in when the police force is failing to discharge any of its functions in an effective manner.
Section 13 of the Public Order Act was last used in 2011 to stop a protest by the far-right English Defence League.
Home Office sources had said the risks of Saturday’s march included groups splintering off from the main procession, the danger of counter-protests clashing with pro-Palestine demonstrators and the unusual route of the march.
The founder of the EDL, Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, had tweeted: “Saturday 11/11/11 London [a reference to the timing of the two-minute silence], your country needs you.”

Sources said the Met would keep seeking and assessing intelligence up until the weekend, and could still seek a ban if the threat reached what it viewed as the legal threshold.
Rowley said: “If over the next few days the intelligence evolves, and we reach a threshold where there is a real threat of serious disorder we will approach the home secretary. Right now, we remain focused on the facts in front of us and developing our plan to ensure the highest levels of protection for events throughout the weekend.”
In his statement, the Met commissioner added he understood the significance of this Remembrance weekend: “I completely recognise the significant public and political concern about the impact of ongoing protest and demonstrations on this moment of national reflection. Therefore I am determined we will do everything in our power to ensure they pass without disruption.
“The reason we have an independent police service is so that among debate, opinion, emotion and conflict we stand in the centre, focused simply on the law and the facts in front of us.
“The laws created by parliament are clear. There is no absolute power to ban protest, therefore there will be a protest this weekend.
“The law provides no mechanism to ban a static gathering of people. It contains legislation which allows us to impose conditions to reduce disruption and the risk of violence, and in the most extreme cases when no other tactics can work, for marches or moving protests to be banned.”
Gideon Falter, chief executive of Campaign Against Antisemitism, said: “If the Met is unable or unwilling to protect our freedoms and values this Remembrance Day weekend, we call on the home secretary to issue section 40 directives to force the Met into action, and call in the army to do what their predecessors did and uphold the values that our country stands for.”
Lawyers for the march organisers, led by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, said they would study the grounds if a ban was sought ahead of launching a potential court battle by seeking a judicial review.
Braverman has described the pro-Palestine protests as “hate marches”. Critics of the home secretary have accused her of fuelling anger and the potential for trouble.
Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said Labour backed the police to make the right decision but suggested Braverman had been “encouraging people to exploit tensions and exploit situations and make them harder for the police to sort out”.",www.theguardian.com,Met police chief defies calls to ban pro-Palestine Armistice Day march in London,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/nov/07/no-grounds-to-ban-pro-palestine-march-in-london-on-armistice-day-met-believes,en,2023-11-07 21:57:35,UK,13,1140,"['Death', 'Hostile_encounter', 'Hostile_encounter', 'Killing', 'Quantified_mass', 'Killing', 'Hostile_encounter', 'Buildings', 'Hostile_encounter']","['who', 'in conflict', 'who', 'Hamas', '1,400 people, mainly civilians', 'in Israel', 'Thousands', 'of civilians', 'Thousands of civilians', 'in the Israeli military operation', 'with pro-Palestine demonstrators', 'home']"

The wreckage goes on for block after devastated block. The smell is sickening. Every day, hundreds of people claw through tons of rubble with shovels and iron bars and their bare hands.
They are looking for the bodies of their children. Their parents. Their neighbors. All of them killed in Israeli missile strikes. The corpses are there, somewhere in the endless acres of destruction.
More than five weeks into Israel’s war against Hamas, some streets are now more like graveyards. Officials in Gaza say they don’t have the equipment, manpower or fuel to search properly for the living, let alone the dead.
Hamas, the militant group behind the deadly Oct. 7 attack that killed about 1,200 people in Israel, has many of its bases within Gaza’s crowded neighborhoods. Israel is targeting those strongholds.
But the victims are often everyday Palestinians, many of whom have yet to be found.
Omar al-Darawi and his neighbors have spent weeks searching the ruins of a pair of four-story houses in central Gaza. Forty-five people lived in the homes; 32 were killed. In the first days after the attack, 27 bodies were recovered.
The five still missing were al-Darawi’s cousins.
They include Amani, a 37-year-old stay-at-home mom who died with her husband and their four children. There’s Aliaa, 28, who was taking care of her aging parents. There’s another Amani, who died with her 14-year-old daughter. Her husband and their five sons survived.
“The situation has become worse every day,” said the 23-year-old, who was once a college journalism student. The smell has become unbearable.
“We can’t stop,” he said. “We just want to find and bury them” before their bodies are lost in the rubble forever.
The Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza says the attacks have killed more than 11,200 people, two-thirds of them women and children. The U.N. humanitarian affairs office estimates that about 2,700 people, including 1,500 children, are missing and believed buried in the ruins.
The missing have added layers of pain to Gaza’s families, who are overwhelmingly Muslim. Islam calls for the dead to be buried quickly — within 24 hours if possible — with the shrouded bodies turned to face the holy city of Mecca. Traditionally, the body is washed by family members with soap and scented water, and prayers for forgiveness are said at the gravesite.
The search is particularly difficult in northern Gaza, including Gaza City, where Israeli ground forces are battling Hamas militants. Hundreds of thousands of people have fled southward, terrified by the combat and pushed by Israeli warnings to evacuate. But even in the south, continued Israeli airstrikes and shelling mean nowhere is safe in the tiny territory.
The Palestinian Civil Defense department, Gaza’s primary search-and-rescue force, has had more than two dozen workers killed and over 100 injured since the war began, said Mahmoud Bassal, the department spokesman.
More than half of its vehicles are now either without fuel or have been damaged by strikes, he said.
In central Gaza, outside the northern combat zone, the area's civil defense director has no working heavy equipment at all, including bulldozers and cranes.
“We actually don’t have fuel to keep the sole bulldozer we have operating,"" said Rami Ali al-Aidei.
At least five large bulldozers are needed just to search a series of collapsed high-rise buildings in the coastal town of Deir al-Balah, he said.
This means that bodies, and the desperate people searching for them, are not the focus.
“We’re prioritizing areas where we think we will find survivors,” said Bassal.
As a result, the search for bodies often falls to relatives, or to volunteers like Bilal Abu Sama, a former freelance journalist.
He ticks off a handful of Deir al-Balah’s victims: 10 corpses still lost in what is left of the al-Salam Mosque; two dozen bodies missing in a destroyed home; 10 missing in another mosque attack.
“Will those bodies remain under the rubble until the war ends? OK, when will the war end?” said Abu Sama, 30, describing how families dig through the wreckage without any tools. “The bodies will be decomposed. Many of them have already decomposed.”
On Tuesday, 28 days after an airstrike flattened his home, Izzel-Din al-Moghari found his cousin’s body.
Twenty-four people from his extended family lived in the home, in the Bureij refugee camp. All but three were killed.
Eight are still missing.
A civil defense bulldozer came three days after the strike to clear the road, then left quickly for another collapsed building. The bulldozer came again Tuesday and helped find al-Moghari's cousin.
After finding his cousin, al-Moghari went back into the wreckage in search of his father and other relatives.
""I am stunned,” he said. “What we lived through is indescribable.”
Gaza has become a place where many families are denied even the comfort of a funeral.
Al-Darawi, the man searching for his cousins, understands that.

The PM was all smiles as he met the republican leader as powersharing government returned to Stormont this morning.
But he later faced down a demand from the nationalists for a vote on Irish unity, after Ms O'Neill suggested one would happen within the next decade.
Speaking to broadcasters he said: 'It is not constitutional change, it is delivering on the day-to-day things that matter to people.'
The call for a referendum sparked a political row as the government in Northern Ireland returned after more than two years away, after the unionist DUP lifted its boycott.
The PM was all smiles as he met the republican leader as powersharing government returned to Stormont this morning.
But he later faced down a demand from the nationalists for a vote on Irish unity, after Ms O'Neill suggested one would happen within the next decade.
The DUP accused Ms O'Neill of focusing on 'divisive' issues rather than improving the lot of the people.
Irish premier Leo Varadkar refused to get involved on the side of Sinn Fein - his political rivals in Dublin.
Asked about the prospect of a reunification vote at a press conference in Stormont, he said: 'I think today is really about marking the fact that the Good Friday Agreement, which we voted for in big numbers north and south, is now functioning again.'
He added: 'I think today really should be about that rather than consitutional change.'
Ministers have already dismissed the prospect, insisting the conditions for holding a poll in the province are 'definitely not met'.
And the DUP accused Ms O'Neill of focusing on 'divisive' issues rather than improving the lot of the people.
The row overshadowed celebrations after powersharing was finally restored at Stormont at the weekend, following a deal with the unionists on post-Brexit trading rules.
Mr Sunak headed to Belfast last night and also met other NI party leaders and Irish premier Leo Varadkar this morning.
During the talks, it is understood the Sinn Fein leaders objected to elements of the recent UK deal with the DUP amid concerns it adopted a pro-Union approach to issues such as a border poll and the development of an all-island economy.
The republican party is understood to have made clear its intent to drive an all-island economy through the economy and finance departments it now holds in the newly-formed ministerial Executive in Belfast.
They also are believed to have stressed the requirement for the UK Government to remain impartial in relation to the calling of any future referendum on Northern Ireland's constitutional future.
The Israel-Hamas conflict was also spoken about, with Ms McDonald understood to have stressed the urgent need for a ceasefire and the need for international rule to be upheld in the region.
With elections due in Ireland this year, there is a real possibility that republicans could run governments on both sides of the border.
The Executive, headed by Ms O'Neill with the DUP's Emma Little-Pengelly serving as deputy First Minister, will hold its first meeting today as it begins the task of trying to manage Northern Ireland's strained finances.
The row could mar celebrations after powersharing was finally restored at Stormont at the weekend, following a deal with the unionists on post-Brexit trading rules
The institutions were restored after a deal between Mr Sunak's Government and the DUP to address unionist concerns over post-Brexit trading arrangements, which included passing new legislation at Westminster.
The UK Government's £3.3billion funding offer is aimed at stabilising finances in the region, and settling public sector pay claims.
The Executive will press Mr Sunak for more funding but he has described the package as 'a generous and fair settlement'.
Mr Heaton-Harris rejected claims by Stormont ministers that better funding is needed from the UK Government as powersharing returns.
The Cabinet minister insisted the £3.3billion package offered by Westminster is 'ample' for the Executive to 'get on with the job'.
On the calls for a referendum, Mr Heaton-Harris told LBC: 'I really don't think that's going to happen but as Secretary of State I am the person responsible in Government to check whether the conditions for that have been met.
'They're definitely not met at this point in time, and I would suggest that actually top of the in-tray for an incoming Executive has to be things like public sector pay, the health service, which needs massive transformation here, funding on education and a whole host of other things that actually all people in Northern Ireland from both communities truly care about.'
He said he would have to be 'confident' that there was a potential majority of people in Northern Ireland 'who would like to depart from their current constitutional status' for the conditions to be met.
Mr Heaton-Harris is joining Rishi Sunak and Irish premier Leo Varadkar in Belfast on Monday to mark the restoration of devolved government.
But the newly-formed Executive has already written to the Prime Minister calling for urgent discussions on long-term funding stability to deliver public services.
Asked about claims that the current funding arrangement will not provide the basis for the Executive to deliver sustainable public services, the Northern Ireland Secretary told BBC Breakfast: 'I don't believe that is the case. I think Stormont has fantastic, strong foundations now and it will survive, it will be sustainable.'
He added: 'There is a thing, I think, about choices. You're going into politics, you have to make choices on these sorts of things.
'Those choices haven't been made for a long time out here, and I believe the new set of ministers are completely capable of running their public finances perfectly well with the fair and generous funding package we've given them.
Ms O'Neill (left) has been installed as First Minister, while the DUP's Emma Little-Pengelly (right) is deputy
'There's a £3.3billion package available to ministers on day one here to get on with the job of sorting out Northern Ireland public sector pay, health services and a whole host of other things, and I'd say that's ample for the time being.'
Mr Sunak and Mr Varadkar will meet each other, as well as the leaders of the new powersharing Executive which was formed on Saturday, ending two years of political stalemate.
Ms Little-Pengelly said Stormont ministers will be 'speaking with one voice' in their talks with the Prime Minister.
She added: 'We will be saying that the people of Northern Ireland deserve better public services and that we need to work together – the Executive and the Government – to deliver long-term fiscal stability.
'We are ready to engage with the Government and get down to the work of putting our finances on a sound footing; however, we will also be seeking to ensure the UK Government provides sufficient funding in a package to fulfil its promises on public sector pay.'",www.dailymail.co.uk,From a handshake to a slap down over Irish unity vote: Rishi Sunak tells Sinn Fein's Michelle O'Neill to concentrate on 'day-to-day' concerns of people in Northern Ireland as she becomes First Ministe,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13046747/Irish-unity-vote-Rishi-Sunak-Sinn-Fein-Michelle-ONeill-Northern-Ireland.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,en,2024-02-05 12:31:55,UK,33,1123,"['Firing', 'Hostile_encounter', 'Quantified_mass', 'Quantified_mass', 'Hostile_encounter']","['Ministers', 'already', 'the prospect', 'Israel-Hamas', 'all', 'people', 'both', 'communities', 'political']"

“The US draft resolution was not balanced and does not reflect the required call for a ceasefire, and therefore it cannot be allowed to pass because it will completely make the Council lose its credibility,” Russia Today website quoted Russia’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Vasily Nebenzia, as saying during a Security Council session.
In turn, the Chinese Representative to the Security Council stressed that the US draft resolution equates the victim with the executioner, and does not reflect the required call for a ceasefire.
The Chinese diplomat called for opening humanitarian corridors, delivering aid to the Gaza Strip, and preventing the forced displacement of its people.

He stressed that the apartheid Zionist regime has once again exposed its evil, murderous, and inhumane nature to the whole world by killing Bahr and thousands of other Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and the West for over 40 days, the Foreign Ministry’s website reported.
Kan'ani noted that undoubtedly, such crimes will not weaken the firm determination of the Palestinian people and Resistance movements to keep fighting on the path to the liberation of their land from the Zionist occupiers.
He called on the international assemblies, organizations, and institutions to fulfill their responsibilities and take immediate deterrent measures to stop the targeted killing machine and organized terrorism of the Zionist regime against the Palestinian people and to hold the Zionist criminals accountable before justice and international law.
The Acting Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council Ahmed Bahr died on Friday as a result of his wounds from an airstrike during the attack launched by the Israeli regime's forces on the Gaza Strip.
On October 23, his wife and children were martyred when the Israeli aircraft bombed their house.

Following the abduction of an infant Palestinian girl from the Gaza Strip by an Israeli soldier, Palestine’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates has denounced the kidnapping as the most heinous crime and called on Israel for her immediate safe return.
In a series of posts via X on Monday, Muhammad Shehada, Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor’s Communications Chief, exposed Israel’s media for glorifying the abduction of the unidentified Palestinian infant by Captain Harel Itach.
🚨An Israeli officer kidnapped a BABY girl from Gaza & brought her to Israel (parents likely killed) per a friend of his

In since-deleted posts from Israel’s Army Radio uploaded by Shehada, Itach is revealed to have abducted the infant from the besieged Strip, which his army has indiscriminately decimated. It is thought that her parents have been killed amid Israel’s onslaught.
According to Middle East Monitor, Itach has died, and the whereabouts of Palestine’s abducted infant girl now remain unknown.
In response, via a communique addressed to Israel on X, Palestine’s Foreign Ministry has said that this instance is further proof of the occupying forces’ genocidal and expansionist aspirations.
Her kidnapping, “deepens our conviction that the occupation army is committing the most horrific crimes of genocide, abuse, direct killing, and kidnapping against defenceless civilians,” Palestine’s MoFA statement said.
The ministry is especially concerned for her welfare, given the clandestine nature by which she was taken.
“What is the child’s health condition? Is she receiving necessary medical attention?” MoFA asked.
In addition to calling on Israel for transparency on the child’s condition, MoFA’s communique “calls on the Israeli side to quickly answer these and other questions and officially hand over the child to the Palestinian National Authority immediately.”
In a news release on December 26, Euro-Med estimated that at least 3,000 Palestinian civilians, including women and children, have been abducted from their homes and shelters in Gaza by the occupation.
“The Israeli army has been detaining hundreds of Palestinians in the Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood in Gaza City. Among them are dozens of women who were taken to Yarmouk Stadium, where they had their veils removed and were searched by soldiers,” the news release said.
Euro-Med added that among the males unlawfully detained, some are as young as ten and as old as 70, or even older. Israel is also inflicting humiliation upon them, by forcing them to remove their clothing, except for their underwear.
International human rights watchdog Amnesty International‘s Crisis Investigation team have surveyed and verified photographs and footage of unlawfully held Palestinian detainees experiencing torture and humiliation.
Worse still, on December 5, Physicians for Human Rights Israel confirmed that since October 7, six Palestinians died while in Israeli detention.
Amnesty has called for an urgent investigation into Israel’s breach of international law.
“All those detained arbitrarily must be released,” said Amnesty’s Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa, Heba Morayef.

103,,"Tehran, SANA- Iranian Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Amir Saeid Iravani, has strongly condemned the US aggression on Syrian and Iraqi territories, framing them as illegitimate and unjustified and violate the basic principles of international law, the UN Charter and the territorial integrity and sovereignty of these two countries.
The Iranian diplomat’s remarks came during a session of the Security Council held Monday.
“The US continues to play a destabilizing role in the region, loot Syrian property and resources and support separatists and terrorist groups there”, Iravani said.
He added “Furthermore, people in Syria are experiencing economic hardship and a humanitarian crisis as a result of the United States’ hostile and harmful actions, as well as the application of illegal sanctions.”
“All these measures violate international law, the UN Charter, and related Security Council resolutions,” the Iranian diplomat affirmed.
Iravani said “It is evident to everyone that the root causes of the current situation in the region are occupation, aggression, and the continued genocide and horrific atrocities committed by the Israeli regime and fully supported by the US against innocent Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and West Bank.”
According to Iravani the “US military attacks against the Muslim nations of the region are the continuation of the complicity of this country in the genocide of the Palestinians through all-out support of the occupying regime and preventing any effective international action to hold that regime accountable.”
We believe that the only solution to end the conflict in the region and prevent the spillover of the war is to return all to their obligations under international law: that is, to force Israel to stop the genocide in Gaza, to establish an immediate ceasefire, to end the presence of US Forces in Iraq and Syria, and to exert pressure to end the occupation of Palestinian territories by the Israeli regime.
Iravani also condemned the joint military actions of the United States and the United Kingdom against Yemen, which he said are also a clear violation of the UN Charter and international laws.

104,"TEHRAN, Dec. 12 (MNA) – The Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas says there will be no new prisoner swap with the Israeli regime until the unrelenting aggression against the besieged territory stops.","In a press briefing in Beirut on Monday, Osama Hamdan, Hamas representative in Lebanon and also a member of the group’s politburo dismissed reports that said the Israeli regime is ready to resume contact with mediators for the possible release of the remaining Zionist prisoners held in Gaza.
“There will be no agreement on the exchange of more captives for prisoners before the onslaught [against Gaza] ceases. The Zionist media reports about the possibility of a new prisoner swap [with Hamas] are meant to mislead the public opinion in the face of increasing domestic discontent,” Hamdan said.
“No compromise is acceptable over the blood of fallen Palestinians. [Israeli prime minister] Benjamin Netanyahu is trying to escape from the regime’s internal conflicts, especially the crisis with the families of the captives held in Gaza.”
Earlier on Monday, the Zionist regime's media outlets claimed that the new prisoner exchange deal would be carried out within the framework of a truce, and would include women still in captivity, patients, the wounded, and elderly people.
It added that Zionist officials believe that the chances of reaching a new prisoner swap deal with Hamas are not likely next week, but the Israeli regime still believes in opening a new path.
Since November 24, Hamas exchanged 110 prisoners, including 80 Zionists, for 240 Palestinians illegally abducted by the regime and kept in Zionist jails during a 7-day pause in the Gaza war.
The truce, meditated by Qatar and Egypt, also allowed the delivery of much-needed humanitarian aid into Gaza after weeks of Zionist attacks on the territory.
Zionist sources claim Hamas still holds 137 prisoners after it carried out Operation Al-Aqsa Storm on October 7 in the occupied territories, during which some 1,200 Zionist settlers and military forces were also killed.
Hamas has repeatedly said that talks over Zionist soldiers being kept in Gaza will be held at a later stage.
A spokesman of Hamas’s military unit, who is known by his nom de guerre Abu Obeida, said on Sunday that the only way for the group to release Zionist prisoners alive is for the Zionists and their supporters to accept its conditions, including the release of Palestinian abductees.
“Neither the fascist enemy and its arrogant leadership... nor its supporters... can take their prisoners alive without an exchange and negotiation and meeting the demands of the Resistance,” Abu Obeida said.
Hamas launched the surprise Operation Al-Aqsa Storm against the occupying entity in response to the Israeli regime’s decades-long campaign of bloodletting and devastation against Palestinians. Since then, the Israeli regime has begun an unprecedented bombing campaign of Gaza and targeted civilians in the Strip.
The Israeli aggression has so far killed at least 18,205 Palestinians, most of them women and children, and wounded 49,645 others.
Zionists have also imposed a “complete siege” on the territory, cutting off fuel, electricity, food, and water to the more than two million Palestinians living there.

Qatar and the World Food Programme director discussed the latest humanitarian situation in Gaza on Saturday as global organisations raise the alarm over the possible rise of deaths caused by hunger amid Israel’s ongoing war.
The discussions took place in Doha between Qatar’s Minister of State for International Cooperation at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Lolwah Al Khater and the WFP’s Executive Director, Cindy McCain.

“The meeting discussed the strategic partnership between the State of Qatar and the World Food Program, the latest developments in the Gaza Strip and the occupied Palestinian territories, and the strengthening of cooperation in Yemen, Sudan and Afghanistan,” Qatar’s foreign ministry said in a statement.
The Gulf state has been working on addressing the dire humanitarian catastrophe on the ground in Gaza under Israel’s genocidal war coupled with the complete blockade that has cut off the population from basic resources and vital aid.
Qatar sent at least 76 flights carrying 2,266 tonnes of aid to Egypt’s El Arish, where aid is being collected before being delivered to Gaza via the Rafah Crossing, the Gulf state’s foreign ministry said in a statement on February 8.
On December 3, Qatar’s Amir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani launched an initiative to sponsor 3,000 orphans and treat 1,500 injured Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Qatar evacuated the 15th batch on Friday, though local authorities did not mention the total number of those receiving treatment in Doha.
Qatar also evacuated Palestinians with Qatari residency permits.
The war on Gaza has entered its fifth month, killing more than 28,000 people while wounding 67,611 others, out of which 11,000 are in need of medical evacuation.
Gaza’s health sector has collapsed due to the non-stop targeting of medical facilities and the absence of adequate medicine and tools for treatment. Only 13 out of Gaza’s 36 hospitals are partially functional and are operating beyond their capacity, according to the United Nations’ latest flash update.
Israeli occupation forces raided the Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis on Friday after besieging the building since January. The Palestinian Red Crescent said the raid lasted “for approximately ten hours,” damaging equipment while interrogating and beating those inside the building.
Israeli forces also prevented those at the hospital from drinking water and using the restrooms.
The PRCS confirmed that occupation forces detained eight of its members at the hospital, including four doctors, four wounded Palestinians, and five of the patients’ companions.
The Nasser medical complex has also been under siege since last month as part of Israel’s intensified attacks on Khan Younis that have forced more Palestinians to flee to densely-populated Rafah.
Rafah is the last remaining area in the besieged enclave where 1.3 million displaced people have been sheltering after they evacuated from northern and central Gaza.
Israel has vowed to expand its ground invasion to Rafah, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordering the Israeli military “to submit to the Cabinet a combined plan for evacuating the population and destroying the battalions”.
The Israeli plans have sparked outrage among the international community including countries currently mediating a possible ceasefire in Gaza, namely Qatar and Egypt.
Qatar condemned Israel’s threats to invade Rafah on Saturday while urging the UN Security Council to prevent Israel from “committing genocide.”
“Qatar condemns in the strongest terms the Israeli threats to storm the city of Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, and warns of a humanitarian catastrophe in the city that has become a last refuge for hundreds of thousands of displaced people inside the besieged Strip,” the Qatari foreign ministry said in a statement read.
Gaza’s population is already grappling with a dire humanitarian crisis with the 2.2 million population completely cut off from aid and basic resources.

Israeli regime forces launched a sustained and forceful military attack against the Gaza Strip in response to a military operation last Saturday by the Palestinian group Hamas in Israel dubbed Al-Aqsa Storm Operation.
In its latest updated figures released by the Zionist regime's army on Sunday morning, it said that the number of soldiers killed during the Palestinian operation increased to 286.
Meanwhile, the occupying regime's prime minister's office said on Sunday afternoon that a total of 1,400 people were killed and more than 3,500 others (soldiers and settlers) were injured as a result of Hamas attacks on occupied territories.

Ali Ahmed said during today’s session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva on the situation of human rights in Palestine and the other occupied Arab territories, within the work of its 54th session, that although we commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, we are unfortunately still dealing in this Council with a unique case in its contradiction with the essence of the Declaration. And what it stipulates is the recognition of the inherent dignity of all members of the human family and of their equal and inalienable rights as a basis for freedom, justice and peace in the world.
We still look in vain at a long-term colonialism based on apartheid that violates all the provisions that humanity has developed in the field of international humanitarian law and international human rights law.
Ali Ahmed pointed out that the settlement policy, which is the main feature of that occupation, is persistent to perpetuate this illegal situation, perpetuate illegal annexation policies, and violate the principle banning the seizure of lands by force.
